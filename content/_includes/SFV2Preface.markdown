Topics : operational semantics, Hoare logic, static type systems

reasoning about the properties of specific programs

reasoning about the properties of programming languages

representing programs as mathematical objects

abstract syntax

big-step and small-step styles

equivalence of programs

correctness of metaprograms, such as compilers and optimizers

Hoare triples : pre-condition and post-conditions

type systems are part of lightweight formal methods = modest power, but efficient, and embeddable in compilers, linkers, analyzers

model checkers, contract checkers, run-time monitoring techniques
